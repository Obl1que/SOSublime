# SOSublime

A neutral colour scheme, based on the theme of https://stackoverflow.com.

This is the dark theme, of course.

# Installation

To install the package, go to your Sublime Text folder, where the application is installed. I am not sure about Windows, but for MacOSX it should be something similar to '/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/'

Next, navigate to the packages folder, you should see multiple folders. Click on the one that says 'Themes', or something similar, depending on if you use a package for managing colour schemes.

Move 'StackOverflow.tmTheme' to this folder after cloning the repository, or just installing the file itself.

Next, open Sublime Text (3). For Windows, press CTRL + Shift + P to open package control (for Mac COMMAND + Shift + P), and type 'UI'. One of the first things to pop up should be 'UI: Select Colour Scheme'. Click on this, then search for the StackOverflow theme. Click on this option, then enjoy!
